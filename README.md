# Audio Summarization Platform using Fine-tuned LLMs

This repository contains my master's thesis project from the National Polytechnic School of Oran, Algeria, focusing on exploring the fine-tuning process of Large Language Models (LLMs) for audio summarization.

## Project Overview

The project aims to develop a web-based audio summarization platform by leveraging the power of fine-tuned LLMs, specifically the Whisper model. The platform provides an efficient way to generate summaries from audio content.

## Features

- Fine-tuning implementation of Whisper model
- Streamlit-based web interface
- Audio processing and summarization pipeline
- Custom dataset integration

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
cd code/app
streamlit run app.py
```
